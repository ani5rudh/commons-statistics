/**
 * Computes the first moment (arithmetic mean) using the definitional formula:
 *
 * <p> mean = sum(x_i) / n
 *
 * <p> To limit numeric errors, the value of the statistic is computed using the
 * following recursive updating algorithm:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Initialize <code>m = </code> the first value</li>
 * <li>For each additional value, update using <br>
 *   <code>m = m + (new value - m) / (number of observations)</code></li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Returns <code>Double.NaN</code> if the dataset is empty. Note that
 * <code>NaN</code> may also be returned if the input includes NaN and / or infinite
 *  values of opposite sign.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong> If
 * multiple threads access an instance of this class concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads invokes the <code>increment()</code> or
 * <code>clear()</code> method, it must be synchronized externally.
 *
 * <p>However, it is safe to use <code>accept()</code> and <code>combine()</code>
 * as <code>accumulator</code> and <code>combiner</code> functions of
 * {@link java.util.stream.Collector Collector} on a parallel stream,
 * because the parallel implementation of {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()}
 * provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
 * safe and efficient parallel execution.
